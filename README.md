## High King Peter the Magnificent

I am **Peter Pevensie**,  
**Emperor of the Lone Islands**,  
**Lord of Cair Paravel**,  
and ***Knight of the Most Noble Order of the Lion***.

âš¡ **Fun fact:** Aslan named me "Peter Wolfsbane"  
ðŸ’¬ **Ask me about:** my battles against the White Witch, the Battle of Beruna, or the Narnian Golden Age  
ðŸ“« **How to reach me:** Find the lamp-post in the wood, then meet Mr. Tumnus the Faunâ€”he will show you the way to Narnia.
